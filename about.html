            Currently I work at Stripe as a product manager of developer tools. Before I worked at Microsoft, LinkedIn, Netflix, Reddit, and other smaller companies. I am currently working my masters of business administration degree at Seattle Univeristy.

                I once won a gaming tournament when I was six. We played Sonic & Knuckles.

                I ate burritos with the band Sugarcult. I don't even like Sugarcult. The burritos are the highlight of this story.

                I am one of the very few people to never graduate college nor ever take the standardized test GMAT and yet still be accepted into a master's program.
